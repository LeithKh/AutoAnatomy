          <h2>Welcome to the WeberAuto Channel at Weber State University (WSU) - Davis Campus in Layton, Utah, U.S.A. The purpose of this channel is to help prepare the next generation of service professionals in the automotive industry.
            The videos I post are related to the topics I teach during the current semester here at WSU. I always strive to keep up to date and bring my students the latest technology as well as teaching them proper diagnostic and service methodology
            Our videos contain highly technical content related to Hybrid and Electric vehicles, Automatic Transmissions, Manual Drivetrain, and Vibration Diagnostics. This is not the Disney Channel. If you are looking to be entertained, this is not the channel for you. </h2>

I grew up in the automotive industry (in my parents shop) and have over 24 years (working full time as a mechanic) experience repairing domestic and Asian cars and light trucks. This is all I've done my whole life. It's my hope and desire to produce videos that provide accurate information saving you time and money while sharing my love for fixing cars, my knowledge and my experiences with you as I travel through automotive repairs day to day in the shop.</h2>
